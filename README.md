# Forecasting-Data---ML-series
Some forecasting because I am bored on Monday night

What I want to do : Try to predict a tendency in some penny currencies prices! This project is only recreational, and for now I am mainly interested 
in finding statistically meaningful results rather than actually implementing a trading strategy (of course, I will if I find some exciting results!)

Let's dive into this and see if we can find some cool results!

Also, there are things that I would be very interested to implement on my own, and I will list them here :
- Ensemble learning for predicting continuous data : I have already used random forest in the past for classification problem, let's try now to do it 
for mean of random forests
- Boosting methods instead of random forest! Something that I was asked for during my interviews and I wasn't very comfortable with it. After some research,
the topic seems very interesting and worth the try
- I would also like to try later with a lot and lots of stock prices and perform PCA for dimensionality reduction

Overall, this project is just a warm-up for a larger project that I have in mind! Stay tuned!
